# Accessible News Reader

This is a small personal project — an accessible news reader app built with React and Vite.  
The idea is to make it easier for everyone, including visually impaired users, to read (or listen to) news online.

---

##  What it currently does

- Fetches news from NewsData.io API  
- Lets users pick language (English, Serbian, German)  
- Can read articles aloud (Text-to-Speech)  
- Dark & light mode  
- Font size slider (for better readability)  
- "Save for later" feature using LocalStorage  
- Works offline as a PWA (Progressive Web App)

##  A quick note

This is just the beginning.  
I probably bit off more than I can chew 😅 — but I'm learning as I go, fixing bugs, and improving things step by step.  
If you have any ideas, suggestions, or want to help — I’d really appreciate it! 😄

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Axios
- Web Speech API
- LocalStorage
- WCAG principles (as much as I could apply)
- vite-plugin-pwa

---

##  How to run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To test PWA build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What's next?

- Nicer UI (still quite basic)
- Proper i18n support (interface translation)
- Topic filters (e.g. tech, politics, etc.)
- Notifications & more accessibility features
